    "description": "Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without requiring the use of automated memory management techniques, such as garbage collection. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its 'borrow checker' tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust was influenced by ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.[13][14][15] Software developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009. In the years following the first stable release in May 2015, Rust was adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Google (Alphabet), Meta, and Microsoft. In December 2022, it became the first language other than C and assembly to be supported in the development of the Linux kernel. Rust has been noted for its rapid adoption,[16] and has been studied in programming language theory research.[17][18][19] History Mozilla Foundation headquarters in Mountain View, California Origins (2006â€“2012) Rust grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare.[20] Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 as a part of the ongoing development of an experimental browser engine called Servo,[21] which was officially announced by Mozilla in 2010.[22][23] During the same year, work shifted from the initial compiler written in OCaml to a self-hosting compiler based on LLVM written in Rust. The new Rust compiler successfully compiled itself in 2011.",
